# TIBER-Teamstate

TIBER-Teamstate is a deterministic TypeScript backend/library for modeling **team-level NFL environments** from team-week source data.

PR4 extends the PR3 reporting layer with downstream-ready ingestion and contract artifacts:

- flexible raw input loading (`file` or `directory` of `.json` files)
- optional season/week filtering during pipeline runs
- explicit pipeline metadata artifact (`pipeline_metadata.json`)
- compact current-state contract artifacts (`current_*.json`) for downstream repos

## Score Model (Separate Scores)

Every `TeamWeekState` emits 0–100 bounded scores:

- **Team Power Score**: Real-life football strength.
- **Fantasy Environment Score**: Strength of a team's own fantasy ecosystem.
- **Matchup Environment Score**: Defensive friendliness for opponent fantasy positions.
- **Stability Score**: Repeatability/process quality.
- **Volatility Score**: Weekly variance/spike dependence.

The architecture intentionally keeps these scores separate (no blended single score).

## Project Structure

- `src/ingest/loadRawTeamWeekRows.ts` – flexible raw file/directory loader + deterministic merge order.
- `src/adapters/mapRawTeamWeekToTeamStateInput.ts` – raw source to canonical mapping adapter.
- `src/ingest/loadTeamWeekInputs.ts` – canonical row validation.
- `src/transform/buildTeamWeekState.ts` – weekly state generation.
- `src/reports/buildLatestWeekReports.ts` – latest-week report builders.
- `src/reports/buildSeasonToDateReports.ts` – season aggregate + ranking builders.
- `src/pipeline/runTeamStatePipeline.ts` – end-to-end orchestration + artifact writing.
- `src/contracts/currentSnapshot.ts` – explicit row contracts for downstream snapshot artifacts.

## Raw Input Ingestion (PR4)

The pipeline accepts:

1. a **single raw json file** containing an array of raw rows
2. a **directory of raw json files** (`*.json` only, merged in stable sorted filename order)

Behavior:

- directory ingestion reads files with deterministic `localeCompare` sort
- all rows are merged into one array before mapping/validation
- invalid JSON or invalid top-level shape fails with a clear file-specific error

## Usage

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Type-check / build

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
```

### Run pipeline (defaults)

```bash
npm run pipeline
```

Defaults:

- input: `data/sample/team_week_raw.sample.json`
- output: `output/`

### Run pipeline with flags

```bash
npm run pipeline -- --input data/sample/team_week_raw.sample.json --output output
npm run pipeline -- --input data/raw --season 2025 --week 8
```

### Positional invocation still works

```bash
node dist/src/pipeline/runTeamStatePipeline.js <raw-input-path> <output-dir>
```

## Filtering (PR4)

Optional filters:

- `--season 2025` → include only rows for season `2025`
- `--week 8` → include only rows with `week <= 8` within the selected data
- `--season 2025 --week 8` → season-specific cutoff

Filtering is applied **before** state build and report generation.

## Output Artifacts

### Existing detailed artifacts

- `teamstate_weekly.json`
- `rankings.*.json`
- `latest_week.*.json`
- `season_to_date.*.json`

### New metadata artifact (PR4)

`output/pipeline_metadata.json` includes:

- `generatedAt`
- `sourceInputPath`
- `sourceFileCount`
- `sourceRowCount`
- `mappedRowCount`
- `filteredRowCount`
- `seasonsIncluded`
- `latestWeekBySeason`
- `selectedSeason` (nullable)
- `selectedWeek` (nullable)

### New current snapshot contract artifacts (PR4)

- `output/current_snapshot.json`
  - top team power/fantasy/matchup slices
  - volatility + stability summaries
  - explicit scope block (`selectedSeason`, `selectedWeek`, `seasonsIncluded`, `latestWeekBySeason`)
- `output/current_offense_environments.json`
  - compact QB/RB/WR/TE current offense environment rows
- `output/current_matchup_environments.json`
  - compact QB/RB/WR/TE current matchup environment rows

All snapshot artifacts use concise row shapes:

- `team`
- `season`
- `latestWeek`
- `score`
- `rank`
- `tags`
- `summary`

## Recommended downstream consumption pattern

1. run Teamstate with your chosen ingest input and optional filters
2. consume `pipeline_metadata.json` first to understand slice + provenance
3. consume `current_snapshot.json` for quick global context
4. consume positional current artifacts for role-specific downstream logic
5. optionally fall back to detailed `latest_week.*` / `season_to_date.*` for deeper diagnostics

## Notes

- No frontend/UI work is included.
- No ML models are used.
- No scraping dependencies on protected third-party sites are introduced.
- Pipeline behavior is deterministic for fixed input rows.
